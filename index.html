There are tombs of two Muslim Sufi saints, Jamal Hussain and Kamal Hussain in the vicinity. Some believe the tombs are under the tree, but the shrine is at a slight distance from the tree and there is a separate entrance to it.
There is also a beautifully reconstructed Sri Rajarajeswara temple on the premises. The temple was transplanted here from Erladinne(erula dinne) on the left bank of the Krishna river.
A board there says the village was about to be submerged during construction of the Srisailam reservoir when the state archaeology department dismantled the temple and moved it to the Pillalamarri complex in 1981.

    The caves are located in the Araku Valley of the Ananthagiri hill range and is drained by the Gosthani River. At the entry, the cave measures up to 100 m (330 ft) horizontally and 75 m (246 ft) vertically. Stalagmite and stalactite formations are found in the caves.</p>
<p>
    The average annual temperature of Araku hills, where the caves are situated, is about 25 °C (77 °F). The average annual rainfall reported is 950 mm (3.12 ft) (mostly occurring during the northeast monsoon). The Gosthani river provides water supply to the Visakhapatnam city.<br/>
    Formation</p>
    <p>
    The Gosthani River, which originates from these caves and flows between the solidified stalactites and stalagmites in the karstic limestones formation, is the cause for the development of the odd shapes of structures. Water percolating from the roof of the caves dissolve limestone and trickle drop by drop to form stalactites at the roof of the cave and then dripping down to the ground form stalagmites.</p><p> These deposits have developed into interesting forms and structures inside the caves such as Shiva–Parvati, Mother–Child, Rishi's beard, human brain, mushrooms, crocodile, temple, church, etc. These shapes have captured the imagination of tourists, while some have been given religious interpretations.<br/>
